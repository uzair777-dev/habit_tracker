To start mariadbd at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mariadb.service to the right place for your system


PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:

'/usr/bin/mariadb-secure-installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb

You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
cd '/usr' ; /usr/bin/mariadbd-safe --datadir='/var/home/uzair/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/habit_tracker/data_p'

You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd '/usr/share/mysql-test' ; perl mariadb-test-run.pl

To start mariadbd at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mariadb.service to the right place for your system


PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:

'/usr/bin/mariadb-secure-installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at https://mariadb.com/kb

You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
cd '/usr' ; /usr/bin/mariadbd-safe --datadir='/var/home/uzair/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/habit_tracker/data_p'

You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd '/usr/share/mysql-test' ; perl mariadb-test-run.pl
